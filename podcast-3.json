Today, my guests are filmmakers, Jewel Taylor and Tony Renton Meyer. We're going to be talking about the Netflix film They Clone Tyrone. Came out just a few weeks ago. It's a movie that follows three friends as they discover and ultimately uncover an underground government cloning operation running experiments in the midst of their own town. And it stars Jamie Foxx, Teona Paris and John Boyega. So going to be talking about Jewel and Tony, who co-wrote the movie together with Jewel directing. So we'll get to hear about the feelings they had of helming their first major picture and the fun of world building and coming up with the small and specific character traits of the throne, as well as watching fans make their own arts. After watching it, they're also going to talk about the underlying messages of the story from conspiracies and capers will dig into the music of the film, calling back to 70s and 80s funk and pop and R&B. And if you've seen it, how they got Erika Badu to re-record one of the classic tracks. All that and more as we're talking, they clone Tyrone. It's Kyle Meredith with Jewel Taylor and Tony Rentenmeyer. Hey, what up guys? How you doing? It is a pleasure to meet you both and they clone Tyrone. I know you're getting lots of compliments and let me just be one more on the pile that this is one of the coolest, funniest, weirdest, best movie I've seen lately. And I mean that seriously, like I didn't read a lot about what I was doing. What I was seeing as I was going into it, me and my wife watching it and it ends up just being like, what? So many times. So just first off, congratulations. Like I love what you guys have done. I think weirdness is the best compliment in that list in terms of what we want to do and stuff. Well, there's a lot that goes into it and I do want to hit on some of the weird parts too. But for this to be your all's, I mean, you've worked in movies, you've got, you know, your filmography behind you, but this is the first big thing right here. This is the first big thing that you're putting your names on. What's the confidence level going into a moment like this? You mean pre-making it? Yeah, like, hey, here's the keys to the kingdom. Now you've got it. Now what? You're on the precipice of day one of shooting and you're like, uh-oh. Honestly, I think we feel like we were confident, but there's always, we've talked about this a few times, there's always a pervasive sense of imposter syndrome and anxiety that's inescapable in a lot of ways, especially like the closer you get to the first day of shooting. Jamie Foxx is in the first scene and you have no idea what it's going to be like to work with Jamie Foxx. So, you know, I think we try not to leave it to chance to put it like that. So we had backup plans for backup plans and, you know, I think, you know, we sat down and blocked out that first day three, four different ways, just in case they're not rocking with this, we're going to shoot it like this. If you're not like that, it's okay. It's okay. We'll start the scene over here, you know. And then, you know, I think we got a lot of confidence in the first day. I think we got a lot of confidence from how approachable the actors were, you know. I think the fact that like John, Jamie, and Tiana were so, you know, gracious. I tell people all the time, I would not have taken the role if I was an actor. You know, if the shoe was reversed, I would not put my faith in some random dudes from USC who you've never heard of. I would not have, you know what I'm saying. So we are eternally grateful that they responded to the material the way they did. And, you know, I think they gave us, you know, the confidence just to stick with the idea, you know, and stick with the vision, you know, while we were shooting, really, because, you know, they were so game to go wherever. Tony, do you guys, since you've been working together so long, do you, I mean, is it down to like a shorthand? What's the operating relationship at this point? Yeah, it is, honestly. I don't notice it when we're working together, but if ever we were talking to someone else, there's a little bit more like leg room that needs to go into like explaining idea to someone else versus us two, you know. I mean, I think it's also, it's not like we're always in sync, you know, with how we think a story or a scene should go or anything, but I think we've and we argue a lot about how, you know, argue about like details of stories or scripts, like, and sometimes about like things that are truly minuscule, you know, but I think that a minute's most often. Yeah, because what matters, what matters to both of us, like those little details is different. Like, I think one of our longest arguments on Tyrone was about like the time of day, like how many hours characters spent underground and like if they come up and it's night, if it's weird, like some small thing like that. But we've done it enough that like now we trust each other so much that like if we're arguing about something, we'll lean into the argument because we know that like if we argue about enough, there'll be like a third option that's better than either the two that we are fighting for. And I think that's the so we're not always like simpatico with what we think we should go, but we have faith that we'll get to a place that's better than what either one of us thought of. That takes a lot to just knowing, knowing that if you're in the middle of that, that you will eventually make it to that moment. Yeah, yeah, it's it's funny, you know, you talking about coming up with those rules to how long they spend underground, you know, like you all get that opportunity, you get to build, you get to make up these rules as you go along. And to figure that out, and I know that's just part of the job. That's part of the storytelling. But like, but like how much like I was starting to think like the little things like do the clones age, you know? Yeah, we talk about all this stuff. We talk we talk about things like clone drift in terms of like how far they drift from their like, mentoring and programming, you know what I mean? In terms of so, you know, trying to plant evidence of, you know, the first spontaneous evidence of his drift, you know what I mean? And and we talk about the ennui that the clones must feel like having like stupid stuff like where we're in the decanting process, do the clones get their hair done? You know, like when they're in the tube, should they be all cut up? Or is that like somewhere like when they get out, like all this? It is. And it is like the fun stuff, honestly, like all that world building, even if it doesn't actually make it directly into the film, it like makes the process fun. You know, sitting in a room for hours on end, just like typing something out. That's always the fun thing. You get on set, you take a lot of times you talk hours about these details, but like production things will decide them for you. We talked so long about like what hairstyles the actors have, I mean, the clones have, and then you realize like you're getting background who's willing to be moved in a pod, you know what I mean? And then the time constraints is like some of them just have a hairstyle. Like, you know, we had decided like natural hair, they'll all have like afros and that, and then like, I probably shouldn't say this because now people are going to point, now people are going to find inconsistencies in the internal logic, but you know, you run into some real life, like casting and timing things where you don't have the time to do the people's hair the way we made this, Lord. It's like, I guess some people just going to have hairstyles that we have to hide, you know, with smoking. It's just, if you look closely enough, you'll see a few clones that come out of the pods who very much have like braids and like, you know, like hairstyles is absolutely not lore accurate at all. Our little bootleg lore that we made, but you know, sometimes you just got to deal with like the production realities. So, you know, a lot of times we do obsess over things that like, when it gets time to make it, it's like you end up conceiving them anyway. Well, as the world builders yourself, I mean, you can make up those backstories if you needed to, like, it doesn't matter what we think. Like if you need to explain it away, you're the creators, you know, we've got our trust in you on all of that. And we'll be right back right after this.

You know, when you talk about what this movie is and it's so many different things, one of the things that is and isn't like it's not exactly a conspiracy movie because we're in the driver's seat. We're seeing it. You know, a lot of things about when we talk about conspiracy is that's something that somebody's going off on that's probably, you know, fake. But we're seeing all this firsthand. But at the same time, it does play into that. Like why, what makes what makes conspiracy fun to play with? Because I would think as a filmmaker that does allow you a lot to move around with if that's if that's true. I mean, I think the fun of conspiracy movies is that there's a little bit of bleed over into real life. Like that's I think the difference between like a conspiracy movie and a pure mystery movie. There is a we always wanted like, you know, our dream was that there were people on Reddit talking about the movie, you know, or, you know, or what the YouTube comments are about. And we're not, you know, like we're not saying that conspiracies presented in Tyrone are true, but they do they are supposed to mimic in some sense, like real world conspiracies. And I think that's that crossover between like a movie seeming like it's like tipping its hat to something in the real world is what I think makes conspiracies fun, you know, as opposed to a mystery movie where the whole question is contained within the two hours of the runtime of the movie. Yeah. And hearing you guys talk about even in other interviews, you know, it's like they're the movie says a lot and it says a lot about what's going on in the world and society and race and everything. But I also hear you guys talk in a way that it's almost like you don't incorrect me if I'm wrong. It almost feels like you don't want to push it too much in that because it's still entertainment. Like, you know, me and my wife are watching it. You know, of course, Tuskegee comes up in conversation, you know, and that's a real life thing. Like that happens and that feels like that's part of the underlying influence, if not maybe a direct influence. But I guess when you talk about what the message is, how much of what you all are making with this movie, you wanted a direct message versus here's entertainment. Take what you will. I think the latter is completely what it is. I mean, I'm from Tuskegee. So, you know, it's obviously they're going to be, you know, people who associate, you know, syphilis experiments with the movie. It's clearly there if you're looking for it, you know what I'm saying? And if you know about that, then obviously you'll see parallels. But I think we went out of our way. We really did go out of our way to try to just present it as just like something that just the bootleg Scooby Doo movie and let the chips fall, you know what I mean? And it comes to how people interpret it, I think the fun is, you know, seeing people just one thing that, you know, I think we believed in philosophically before baking it, but before you make it, it's kind of hard to it comes in practice. One thing that I think is the funnest thing is really seeing how we've never been able to, we thought we would like it, but I think, you know, our hypothesis is true, correct. But seeing how something mutates when it's given to other people. And I mean, it goes beyond, you know, just how people theorize and how people interpret it that was completely different than we were working on it, right? Like you'll have your set of this means this, this means this, this means this, but you know that someone's going to watch it and think, you know, X doesn't equal 76, X equals 95, you know what I mean? Like they're going to have a completely different interpretation for something. And I think that's one of the funnest parts of seeing like how people interpret it, you know, what people metabolize out of it, what they don't, you know, I mean, it's, I think just seeing how other people interact with body and work, you know, and seeing like what kind of mutations come, seeing what means come out of it, you know, the really like seeing like, you know, I was like hoping that somebody would do a painting or something, some kind of art and sure enough, somebody did and it was like, oh, yes, you know what I mean? And then a dude took the soundtrack and chopped and screwed it there yesterday. And it was like, yes, like, you know, people are appropriating it already, you know what I mean? Which I think is super interesting. And I think that works for like the theory crafting and the thematic takeaways as well as like, you know, people's like making art on top of your art, you know what I mean? And like, I think that's been the funnest thing. So, you know, we didn't set out to prescribe anything to anyone, you know, I mean, it was just things that were bothering me that conversations that me and Tony had that we wanted to explore in the movie. I think, you know, we definitely been like pleased to see them like a lot of theories have popped up, you know, that's probably been one of the funnest points. We've always like looked at it first and foremost as entertainment and then secondary, like we never saw it as a lesson plan. Like it was more like a tool that people wanted to talk about stuff. But like it wasn't neither of us wanted to present it like we knew more than anybody watching it. And we had like some great like truth or lesson to like imprint on them. Definitely not sociologists. We're not qualified to talk in a two hour movie about anything super deep, you know what I'm saying? We might be talking about things that we're not qualified to answer anything. We can we can make observations. I think that's about as far as we take it. The conversations are fun afterwards, though. And again, you know, we're sitting around watching it. And my wife, who's usually much smarter than me, as you'll find out as I keep quoting her, she she looked at she turns over and she goes, she goes, it really makes you think about the simulation theory. And and then, you know, of course, we're talking about aliens and everything else that's around at the time, you know. And yeah, and I started thinking of movies like like Dark City and the 13th Floor. This is all the stuff we hoped would happen because that even goes like simulation stuff goes even outside of even the box that like Tyrone presents itself in, you know. So, yeah, I mean, that that stuff's like music to our ears. You know, I got to bring up music, of course, too, since you said the word there, because, well, we got 80s R&B and funk. Let's see here. I know I clocked Michael Jackson. I think there's some Bootsy Collins in there. And I'm not even getting to the one at the end yet with with Erica. And maybe it was one of you that said it, maybe it was you that said you tend to think in song and you think like what were you talking about there? It's not so much that I think in music like singing the singing the words necessarily. It's more of that like I think in music when I'm ideating, a lot of times I'll have a feeling and a mood or tone and it'll be a song that like encapsulates it, right. And you'll be trying to replicate how a certain song makes you feel. This goes with almost anything, like any script that we work on. You know, it's always a feeling that I get from music primarily that filters to feel, you know, and so I'll be feeling a sense of melancholy from listening to James Blake. I'll be listening to retrograde and feeling very melancholic and all of a sudden, melancholic ideas start to come out and then suddenly you're writing, you know, you're writing a love story. You know, like, you know what I mean? Like it's that's very reductive but you know, the representation process, but I mean, kind of what it is in simple terms, you know, I think I'll have like, you know, feelings from songs and then just images just start like popping in my head. So then it's like a matter of trying to deconstruct like what that means, you know, and then we talk about a lot and find songs and you know, eventually it starts to make some semblance of sense after a while but it's always like for me, like, how am I feeling when I hear something? Because I get like very intense feelings when I listen to different things, you know what I'm saying? So I want to feel like I want to feel that when I'm watching stuff, you know, like my favorite movie moments a lot of the time are like when the music and the score or needle drop and like it just when it synergizes and like you get that endorphin burst in the back of your neck like out belt, that's the kind of stuff, you know, if you're watching like some shonen anime, you know, where, you know, they really like hit you in the feels with the score writers, you know, there's a lot of examples that you can feel in the shonen world but I think that's really kind of where it comes from. I have a lot of nerdy things but probably the nerdiest thing is that I collect soundtracks and I just have a wall of soundtracks and scores and you know, Tyrone soundtrack on the wall, you know? I need to sound, I need to sound, is there a physical copy of that? We're trying to get a vinyl, you know what I'm saying, in Netflix or something, you know, somebody, somebody needs to. I've got the stranger things vinyl, I know they can do it. I know someone needs to do it but, you know. I feel like they should make like an eight track or something, that'd be really cool.

Obviously we're in a period in this movie and there's a little things like the you know I don't know what you call the film or the filter you know that that the look of the film anyway even down to uh you know when Tyrone's going through the house and he gets to the break room and there's that clock on the wall I'm like yeah it's the clock on the wall from the 70s and 80s that's that's my school clock you know so I mean how did you end up in this specific period like why did you all pick this specific period for the look for the music and maybe not necessarily the time though? Uh yeah I mean there was there was always this idea of being able making the Glenn like out of space and out of time and like for that like a big inspiration with stuff like Napoleon Dynamite or It Follows where there seems to be these anachronism in these in this otherwise modern world and it creates this like just a little bit of like universality to it you know the idea that this could be happening anywhere at any time I think uh the way Dwells described it good is that like you know there are or it's like the cognitive dissonance that comes with like seeing a building that used to be a Pizza Hut and is now like you know a vet store or something you know it's this like you know what it is but now it's something different and it's like it's neither one or the other I think that like little bit of disassociation or something just we wanted that in the tone of the movie uh partially for a world building and partially just for a stylistic reason It's fun it is funny it just I don't know it feels weird as we talk about the weird it just feels weird in the best way you know how it all kind of comes like that um before I forget to ask because I brought up Mendegeo but we do end with Erykah Badu and it's not just Tyrone it's a new version of Tyrone how how did you all get that to happen? A lot of people don't notice that too and I'm still wondering how we got that you know um they set up a um a meeting with Erykah when we were in pre-production so this is maybe like fall 2020 something like that and uh it's like a zoom meeting and we were expecting to like do the whole pitch like we actually pitched the movie without a script but we pitched Erykah Badu doing the last song before so so we always joked that like she was doing the song she was there before the script was there you know that's how we like to think about it you know the second we second we was like all right we're really gonna call it Big Clone Tyrone because that was a joke title for a long time the second we decided like really call it Big Clone Tyrone it's like well the next decision made is like obviously Erykah Badu has to remake Tyrone for us in some kind of way um and we had the zoom meeting with uh Erykah and we we get like two minutes in and she was like I'm in I'm doing it it was like what like you know like I was trying to explain that we wanted to burn steam bears it but she took the words out of my mouth literally you know like imagine an alternate you mean you want me to burn steam bears it I'm like Erykah I knew this one I knew yeah she knew right away and then the first like snippet that she sent me was literally like because you know I was like oh we want the live version of the song she's like okay I'm gonna have to rebuild it but I think I got you I got you so she remade it from scratch because like she didn't she doesn't have any stems for a live recording but the live recording is the one most people put the song for not the album though and so it's like you really need that live recording for it to feel like it's the one that we know the best and she totally just from the first meeting she was all the way in and really just that's all Erykah she just went off and did it and just brought it back it was like that's exactly what I was talking about that's amazing and it's amazing too that you got the live because I noticed that at the beginning because you know she does the ladies where you had fellas you know and then and then you're thinking like of course you know Tyrone and then you hear those first words you're like wait a second all the response at the beginning you know the whole thing I mean that's what like she got every detail she recreated every detail in like 2022 even though you know the song is 20 years old you know saying more than 20 25 years old you know but she recreated all of these live the crowd is recreated the the call and response you know I'm saying it's like she remade it all and EQ'd it in such a way that it you know it sounds so close to the original version you really have to listen to them side by side to like notice the differences that's incredible uh you know I congratulate I congratulated you on the movie but congrats on on that that's what we really take pride in it's like we we got Erykah by doing it to like make Tyrone again that's really the the biggest swing that we took oh well we got Erykah to do something like amazing and I mean like Jules like beyond just getting like convincing Erykah to redo the song and stuff like Jules more involved in the music of this of you know he's modest about it but like obviously like all directors are involved with the music but Jules like very intimately involved in it and to the extent of like going in the studio and being with our composer Desmond Murray who he used to make who is a childhood friend that they made music since they were kids together so uh yeah he's he's like historically very modest about it and I do think it's one of the best parts of the film you know so well seriously and just another reason why we need a physical soundtrack too so that exists uh and those are fun I mean you know you get in the play I don't know if you call that an easter egg but it's sort of like an easter egg if because you got to pay attention you got to find it and and hearing just knowing those moments are everywhere we also at the end of it I was like I was like googling Olympia Black going is this a real person you know it's like it is it's taking everything further you know outside of the movie it's exactly what I think you guys have been talking about this whole time it's I I haven't had that experience in a long time yeah we wanted to plant enough easter eggs that people were rewarded going down those like rabbit holes those Wikipedia rabbit holes and stuff uh I hope you guys continue to do that I mean surely hopefully you're talking about the next projects and in this is if this is what I can expect from you all as a team thank fucking god somebody is doing it in the perfect world we'll be able to in the future make more original stuff well I hope so um this is it's one of my favorite movies I've seen in a long time so guys thank you for what you're doing thank you for taking the time to talk about it
