# whisper-podcast-transcriber

This repo contains the codes for the project for the [uplimit](https://uplimit.com/) course on [Building AI products with OpenAI](https://uplimit.com/course/building-ai-products-with-openai). In this project, we build an LLM app that summarizes a podcast episode, identifies podcast guests, identifies key highlights, using open ai gpt-3.5-turbo, [Modal](https://modal.com/apps/sschangi/corise-podcast-project) (as the cloud server), and streamlit. The built app can be found at https://whisper-podcast-transcriber-wr7siwib53pkf3zq7bshyy.streamlit.app/. The main code for the app is `podcast_transcriber_code_whisper.ipynb`.
