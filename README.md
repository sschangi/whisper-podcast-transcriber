# whisper-podcast-transcriber

This repo contains the codes for project for the uplimit course on Building AI products with OpenAI. In this project, we build an LLM app that summarizes a podcast episode, identifies podcast guests, identifies key highlights, using open ai gpt-3.5-turbo, [Modal](https://modal.com/apps/sschangi/corise-podcast-project) (as the cloud server), and streamlit. The built app can be found at https://whisper-podcast-transcriber-wr7siwib53pkf3zq7bshyy.streamlit.app/. The main code for the app is `podcast_transcriber_code_whisper.ipynb`.
